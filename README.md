The Bookshop Management System is a simple yet powerful C program designed to efficiently manage the operations of a bookstore. It provides an easy-to-use, menu-driven interface that allows an administrator to control the inventory and handle sales seamlessly. The system begins with an admin login secured with a password to prevent unauthorized access. Once logged in, the admin is presented with a variety of features. They can add new books to the inventory by providing essential details like Book ID, Title, Author, Genre, Quantity, and Price. The admin can display all available books in the system with their complete details, and if needed, they can modify existing book information such as updating the title, author, genre, quantity, or price. The system also allows the admin to delete books from the inventory if they are no longer available.

An important feature is the search functionality, where books can be searched either by ID, Title, or Author name, making it easy to locate specific items quickly. Customers can buy books by selecting the book ID and the desired quantity; the system automatically checks for available stock, updates the inventory, records the sale details, and calculates the total price. The system keeps a track of all sales transactions and provides a sales report showing the quantity sold and the revenue generated from each book along with the total revenue earned. To organize the inventory better, the admin can sort books based on Book ID, Title, or Author in ascending order.

Additionally, the system includes a low stock warning system that alerts the admin whenever a book’s quantity drops below a threshold, helping to restock before it runs out. Throughout the program, input validation and user-friendly messages guide the user to perform tasks smoothly. Overall, the Bookshop Management System covers all fundamental bookstore operations — including inventory management, purchasing, sales tracking, sorting, searching, and reporting — making it an essential tool for small to medium-sized bookshops to manage their day-to-day activities efficiently without any hassle
